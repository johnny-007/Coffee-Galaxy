# Coffee-Galaxy

A responsive coffee shop website built with React and styled using Tailwind CSS. This project features a modern design with a dynamic UI and smooth interactions, perfect for showcasing coffee-related content.

## React + Vite

This project uses Vite for a fast development environment. It also integrates React for building the UI components.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh.
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh.
